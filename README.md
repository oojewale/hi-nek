## HiNek

It's the election season in My country; Feb - Mar, 2019. I thought to put this little app up, probably to serve as a memorial of the season.

## What Does The App Do?

Allows citizens to register both as candidates and electorates. There's also a fixed list of offices that candidates can contest.

## Features
* Takes biodata of citizens.
* Allows citizens to download or print a temporary voters card.
* Allows candidates to download proof of candidacy slip for registered candidates.


## Gotchas
* Does not allow candidates who aren't registered as citizens to register.
* Can probably allow people to register and be able to save state their current session, so that people who do not complete the registration can come back and not continue.


## Specs
* `bundle exec rspec`

PS: Should update this README with time.
