It's the election season in My country; Feb - Mar, 2019. I thought to put this little app up, probably to serve as a memorial of the season.

## What Does The App Do?

* Allows eligible citizens to register for voters slip.
* Those who want to be candidate could also show interest in being candidates.
* There's a fixed list of offices that candidates can contest.
* Allows citizens to download or print a temporary voters slip with image & signature.
* Allows admin to update a citizen's profile when their permanent voter's slip is ready.
* Sends sms to citizen when permanent voter's slip is ready.


## Gotchas
* Does not allow candidates who aren't registered as citizens to register.
* Could probably allow people to register and be able to save state their current session, so that people who do not complete their registration can come back and not continue.
* There might be need to turn off "candidates citizens" after election.
* Could add states, constituency and all that but this is just a "dummy".
* Could probably think about this in a million ways but let's get the dummy code out.


## Specs
* `bundle exec rspec`
